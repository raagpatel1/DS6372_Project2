# DS6372_Project2
DS6372 Final Project

Here, you will find the EDA file, and we all will be able to work from the same data easily. 

We are going to use the third option dataset.

We'd like to start with the EDA on Friday (11/18) night by the latest and have the project all wrapped up 1 week before the due date. The official due date is 12/04, and we'd like to have it done by 11/27. 

We are not turning in a paper for this project, we are turning in a video presentation. We don't need to be in a call and record it together, it'll be smoother and easier if we all record it on our own and send it to Raag Patel to put together. Raag Patel will talk about the logistics of that as we get closer to submission. 

We are splitting up the tasks in objective 2, as The Professor wants 3 models. Raag Patel will going to take the first model, which is the complex logisitic regression model. Michael Shulte feels comfortable tackling either the non-parametric model or the LDA/QDA model, Nicole Assenza has her choice of the two. In this objective it is expected that we go through the general workflow for our respective model and do a deeper EDA if needed. 

After all the coding is done, we will come together, talk about the code and the outputs, make sure all the expected deliverables are there, and then Raag Patel will explain our recording process.

Currently (11/16), the slides are all themed uniquely, and named corresponding to the slide theme. Feel free to play around with what slide theme you want to use.
